If you are just a 10+2 pass out and looking forward to build a great career by doing Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) course which is a 3 year degree course recognized by UGC and being taught in most good Engineering colleges and in some good regular colleges, this blog will definitely help you to select your preferred college to complete your BCA course. 
Since BCA is a professional course, just like B.Tech/BE in Computer Science & Engineering course (as 80% of the syllabus is almost same in both the courses), it demands the same kind of classroom facilities and Lab resources along with experienced faculties to deal with the subjects and Lab experiments required by the  course syllabus.  And again, after complementing any professional course, one must expect to get a decent job before leaving the college life. That’s why a good placement cell is a strong requirement for a college offering BCA course. And above all, one must see whether the college/Institute has proper accreditation from technical academic authorities like AICTE, NAAC etc. 
Hence before selecting any college or institution, one must consider these parameters by doing proper research about that particular college before taking the admission.
